# Software-Design-Document
The client is The Gaming Room. The type of software that they wanted me to design is a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It that serves multiple platforms.
What I particularly did well in developing this documentation is in the Excutive Summary, Requirements, Design Constraints, System Architecture View, and the Domain Model.
I did find it helpful to develop the code because of the design document. The reason why, is that it helped to explain how to go about it.
One part of my work of these documents that I would choose to revise is the Recommendations. I would improve by explaining Storage Management, Distributed Systems and Networks, and Security better.
How I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my software design, is that I knew that they needed a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It to be able to run on multiple platforms. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing so that they can get a good product that would be able to do what they needed to be done.
How I approached the designing of the software, is that I knew it had to be able to run multiple players on multiple platforms. The techniques or strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application would be that I would research more.
